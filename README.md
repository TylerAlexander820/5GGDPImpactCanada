# 5GGDPImpactCanada
This Python code seeks to estimate the GDP Impact of 5G in Canada

Predicting the potential GDP impact of 5G is vital to determining whether it is a technology that we should focus on deploying. Should 5G technology prove to have a tangible benefit on the economy, industries and government would more than likely invest in this technology. However, due to events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasting the benefits of 5G can be very difficult. This paper seeks to estimate the potential economic effects that 5G can have on the Canadian economy. In calculating the estimate, an understanding of the importance of investing and regulating this technology can be understood.
